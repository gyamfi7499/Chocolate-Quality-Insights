# OVERVIEW
This project analyzes over 1,000 expert-rated dark chocolate bars from the Flavors of Cacao dataset. The goal was to uncover patterns in chocolate quality by examining ratings, cocoa percentages, bean types, and company locations. Insights from the analysis help identify top-performing chocolate makers, consumer preferences, and global trends in chocolate quality.

#  TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES

* Power BI (Data visualization, interactive dashboards, trend analysis)
* Microsoft Excel (Power Query -Data cleaning, transformation, preprocessing)
* Data Analysis Expressions (Calculated measures, KPIs, filters)
* Data Modeling (Relationships between chocolate makers, bean origins, ratings, cocoa %)

 #  DATA SOURCE
 * Blossom Academy


#  DATA PROCESSING

* Cleaned raw dataset (removed missing and inconsistent values).
* Transformed variables (Extracted review year, converted cocoa % to numeric)
* Created calculated fields (Rating categories -Elite, Premium and Satisfactory)
* Modeled relationships between chocolate makers, company locations, bean types, and ratings.
* Built interactive dashboards for trends exploration, distribution analysis, and performance benchmarking.

#  SKILLS DEMONSTRATED

* Data Cleaning And Transformation

* Data Modeling And Dax Calculation

* KPI And Visualization Design

* Transforming Analytics into Actionable Insights

* Business Oriented Problem Solving


#  OBJECTIVES AND BUSINESS PROBLEMS

* Which companies and regions produce the highest-quality chocolate.
* What bean types and cocoa percentages lead to higher consumer ratings.
* How chocolate quality trends have evolved over time.
* What strategies can be implemented to improve chocolate ratings and move products from Satisfactory to Premium/Elite.

#  ANALYTICAL THOUGHTS AND FRAMES

* Rating Distribution (Majority of chocolates are only “Satisfactory” (69%), with very few achieving “Elite” quality).
* Trend Over Time (Quality dipped around 2008 but has steadily improved, peaking in 2017).
* Company Location (Italy, Canada, and France outperform the US and UK in average ratings).
* Top Makers (Soma, Bonnat, and Fresco are leaders in consistent chocolate excellence).
* Bean Types [Nacional beans perform best (3.3 avg rating), while Arriba beans lag (2.8)]. 

# RECOMMENDATIONS

* Focus on bean sourcing  (Prioritize Nacional and Trinitario beans for better product quality).
* Optimize cocoa percentage (Target 68–73% range for consumer-preferred balance of flavor and bitterness).
* Learning from top makers (Adopt best practices from Soma, Bonnat, and Pralus to improve consistency).
* Expanding into high-performing regions (Consider collaborations with European chocolatiers to leverage expertise).
Aim for more “Premium/Elite” products (Invest in innovation and quality processes to reduce the dominance of “Satisfactory” chocolates)

# CONCLUSION

This analysis highlights that while most chocolates are satisfactory, there is significant opportunity to elevate quality standards. By refining cocoa content, sourcing better beans, and adopting practices from top-performing regions and companies, chocolate makers can improve ratings, brand reputation, and consumer satisfaction.
